# AMA Guides 6th Edition WPI Extraction and Prediction Prompt

## Objective
Extract and structure medical impairment data from a provided medical report to predict Whole Person Impairment (WPI) percentages based on the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 6th Edition, with a primary focus on pulmonary impairments. Ensure precise alignment with AMA methodology for classifying and adjusting impairment levels, consolidating duplicate information, and providing a detailed rationale for all calculations.

## Input Requirements
For each case, the medical report must provide the following structured information:

1. **Patient Demographics**
   - Name: Full name if available, omit if not
   - Age: Exact age or derived from DOB in MM/DD/YYYY format, omit if unavailable
   - Sex: Male/Female/Other
   - Occupation: Current or former
   - Relevant Dates: Dates of injury, onset, treatment, or exams in MM/DD/YYYY format

2. **Medical Team**
   - Treating Physicians: List names and specialties
   - Other Providers: List names and roles

3. **Medical History**
   - Timeline: Consolidated history of injuries, diagnoses, surgeries, and treatments
   - Current Medications: List with dosages and frequencies
   - Past Medical History: Relevant conditions

4. **Current Status**
   - Symptom Summary by Body System: List symptoms by system
   - Key Abnormal Exam Findings: Include measurements
   - Significant Diagnostic Test Results: Include test results with dates and measurements

5. **Clinical Findings**
   - **Key Factor** (select one per AMA chapter guidelines):
     - Objective Test Results
     - Include exact measurements, dates, and % predicted values
   - **Non-Key Factors**:
     - History of Clinical Presentation: Document symptoms
     - Physical Examination: Document findings
     - Functional History: ADL limitations, include validated self-report tools if available
     - Clinical Studies: Supporting data
     - Burden of Treatment Compliance (BOTC): Document treatment requirements

6. **Pain Assessment** (if relevant):
   - Type: Nociceptive/Neuropathic
   - Duration: Acute/Chronic (>3 months)
   - Characteristics: Describe pain
   - Chronic Pain Syndrome (CPS) Criteria Met: Yes/No, list applicable criteria per AMA Guides
   - Objective Evidence: Document tests

## Strict Requirements
1. **Consolidation**: Extract ONLY UNIQUE impairments, injuries, or conditions, merging duplicates into a single entry.
2. **Impairment Details**: For each unique impairment, include:
   - **Clinical Description**: Consolidated summary of the condition
   - **Key Findings**: Objective test results driving the initial class
   - **Non-Key Factors**: Subjective symptoms and physical findings with point assignments
   - **Impact**: Combined functional limitations
   - **AMA Reference**: Specific table and chapter
   - **Preliminary Class and Adjustment**:
     - Initial class based on key findings, defaulting to the middle grade (C) per the relevant AMA table
     - Point adjustments from non-key factors
     - Adjustments must stay within the same class
   - **Possible WPI**: Percentage range based on the adjusted class (don't be specific, make sure it's in range of 0%-100%)
3. **Pain Handling**: Rate pain separately only if neuropathic pain is present with objective evidence. Otherwise, include pain as a non-key factor for adjustment.
4. **Combination**: Combine regional impairments using the Combined Values Chart before converting to WPI.

## Processing Rules
1. **Consolidation**: Merge duplicate findings, using the most recent result.
2. **Data Retention**: Retain only the most recent and relevant data, removing redundant or outdated findings.
3. **Objective Tests**: Explicitly include ALL objective test results as key findings; flag missing tests.
4. **Non-Key Adjustments**: Assign point values to symptoms and physical findings based on AMA class descriptions. Calculate net points to adjust within the class.
5. **AMA Methodology for Pulmonary Impairments**:
   - Use key findings to determine the initial class
   - Adjust the grade (A-E) based on non-key factors using point totals
   - Provide the WPI range based on the adjusted class per the relevant table
6. **Validation**:
   - Reject predictions if:
     - Subjective complaints lack objective correlates (per Chapter 2.4b)
     - Pain rating exceeds 3% without neuropathic evidence
     - Adjustments would cross class boundaries
   - Flag cases requiring:
     - Specialist consultation
     - Additional testing
7. **Terminology**: Maintain original medical terminology and flag inconsistencies.
8. **WPI**: Final WPI should be in the range of 0% - 100%, not just a specific value

## Notes
- Always reference specific tables/chapters
- Disclose limitations when data is incomplete
- Ensure all objective test results are reported with dates and % predicted values
- Use the Combined Values Chart for multiple impairments
- Be very sure of numbers especially points values and all other specific values , ensure they're highly clearly accurate from the retrieved docs to avoid too many errors in output]
- Ensure output is a well formatted markdown, do not put things that are supposed to be key points in a straight line. separation and clear markdown output is important
- Ensure you increase your accuracy on the WPI section, as it's the most important part of the report, so prioritize it.
- Beacon making up stuff in the report is super bad, ensure you only output highly accurate details
